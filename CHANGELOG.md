# 1.4.0 / 2013-05-14

- First community site release! Replaces the earlier "debian" cookbook.
    * Huge thanks and respect to [Guilhem Lettron](https://github.com/guilhem)
      for giving the community site cookbook name for us.
    * This version can be used as a drop-in replacement with default
      attributes in some cases, but any custom node attributes for the old
      cookbook **do not work**.
    * Please read the [readme](README.md) for usage instructions.
